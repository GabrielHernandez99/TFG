# How to use this Repository

Hi! This is currently an old project that I used as my final university project. In case you're curious to see how it works, here's an easy guide in order to navigate! Enjoy!!!

## About this project

This is a home made electrical bill comparator, where it is needed to login in order to use it. There are 2 types of users, being the bidders and the consumers. The first one
can create, update and delete their offers; while the latter can compare how much they'll pay monthly using a formula. Both users can simulate their electrical bills and can check
how's the kW price per hour on the home menu. Currently the API's down.

### When cloned, it's important to perform the command "npm i" in case there are no node_modules imported.

### This project was developed by myself, and studied with the assist of my last project teachers. This was my very first contact with React.JS, developed with Javascript, and used Firestore as it's database.

### In case of doubts, contact me :)
